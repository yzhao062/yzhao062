### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üòÑ **I am on the market with expected graduation in Summer 2023**. I am broadly interested in *machine learning*, *data mining and science*, and *information science and systems* positions.
I can work in the U.S., Canada, and China without sponsorship; please reach out if you have an open opportunity in either academia or industry!  Please reach out by email (zhaoy [AT] cmu.edu)

üå± **Short Bio**: I am a 4-th (final) year Ph.D. student at 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Before joining CMU, I earned my Master degree from University of Toronto (2016) and Bachelor degree from University of Cincinnati (2015), and worked as a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html) (2016-19). 
I am an expert on anomaly detection (a.k.a outlier detection) algorithms, systems, and its applications in security, healthcare, and Finance, 
with more than 7-year professional experience and 30+ papers (in JMLR, TKDE, VLDB, NeurIPS, etc.). 
I am honored to be one of the two winners of [2022 Norton Labs Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/research-labs/news/2022-fellowship-winners/). See my [homepage](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) and [CV](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/files/ZHAO_YUE_CV.pdf) for more information.

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/),
[Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2), 
and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/).
I am a member of [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/) and [CMU automated learning systems group (Catalyst)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/).
Externally, I collaborate with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford, [Prof. Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) at Rice University, and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/) at UIC.


**Contributions to reproducible, automated, and scalable outlier detection**: 
I use *machine learning systems (MLSys)* techniques to support large-scale, 
real-world outlier detection applications in security, finance, and healthcare with millions of downloads. 
I designed CPU-based ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), 
GPU-based ([TOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/tod)), 
distributed detection systems ([SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod)) 
for tabular ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), time-series ([TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)), 
and graph data ([PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod)). 
To understand the characteristics of OD algorithms, I co-author *large-scale benchmarks* for tabular data ([ADBench](https://openreview.net/forum?id=foA_SFQ9zo0)),
time-series data ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr)), and graph data ([BOND](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXvGXEmtZ5N)).
My work has been widely used by thousands of *projects and applications*, including 
Amazon, IBM, Morgan Stanley, and Tesla. See [more applications](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/network/dependents).
