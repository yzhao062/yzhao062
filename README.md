### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) 👋

⚠️ **Impersonation Warning**: I do **not** have any account on Twitter/X.  
Any account using my name or affiliation on that platform (e.g., `@yzhao062`) is impersonating me.  
Please refer only to my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) or official links below for accurate information.

😄 I am an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/); see the latest information at my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/).

**Prospective Students**. We are seeking to recruit **no more than 1 Ph.D. students** for Fall 2026. Applicants are required to have a few published papers in top ML, System, or NLP conferences.  We also have openings for **undergraduate and graduate interns**, both from USC and other institutions. For all positions, please complete this Google Form: [Application Form](https://forms.gle/F2ZXqFWh9wgmUcHDA). Additionally, Ph.D. candidates are required to email me directly after submitting the form.  See details at [my homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html).

🌱 **Research Interests**. My research focuses on building *Robust, Trustworthy, and Scalable AI systems* by addressing challenges at three distinct but connected levels: the *Principle Level*, the *Knowledge & Generation Level*, and the *System Level*. Through these levels, I integrate reliable detection methods, graph-based structured knowledge, generative modeling, and open-source tools to advance AI4Science, healthcare, finance, and political science.

1. **Robust and Trustworthy AI (Principle):** Ensuring AI systems can detect outliers, anomalies, and out-of-distribution data to provide trust, fairness, and transparency across different domains.  
   **Keywords:** OOD Detection, Outlier Detection, Anomaly Detection, Trustworthiness.

2. **Structured and Generative AI for Science and Applications (Knowledge):** Leveraging graph-based learning to understand interconnected data and applying generative AI methods, large language models, and foundation models to address scientific challenges in drug discovery, synthetic clinical trials, and political forecasting.  
   **Keywords:** Graph Learning, Graph Anomaly Detection, LLMs, Foundation Models, AI4Science, Drug Discovery.

3. **Scalable and Open-Source AI (System):** Developing efficient tools and frameworks for automated model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and large-scale anomaly detection. As the creator of [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) (25M+ downloads, used by NASA, Tesla, etc.), I lead [10+ open-source projects](https://github.com/yzhao062), including [PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod), [TDC](https://tdcommons.ai/), and [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench), which collectively have earned more than 20,000 GitHub stars, accelerating AI adoption and impact.  
   **Keywords:** Automated ML, Distributed Systems, Open-source AI, Scalability.

⚡  **Open-source Contribution**: I created PyOD (used by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and more) - the most popular library for anomaly detection in 2017. Also, I have led more than 10 ML open-source initiatives, receiving 20,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%) and >22M downloads. **Popular ones**: PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, ADBench
