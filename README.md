### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã


I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/phd-programs/), 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/)--the best interdisciplinary research institute in the world. 
Before joining CMU, I was a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).

I consider myself as an expert in **outlier detection systems** (ODSys)---I build automated, scalable ODSys to support
real-world applications with millons of downloads. Under my ODSys universe, I designed CPU-based, GPU-based, distributed systems for tabular, TS, and graph OD.

More specifically, I have **led** or **contributed as a core member** [> 10 ML open-source initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), receiving 12,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 900 out of 40M GitHub users) and >500,0000 total downloads.


I specialize in designing and building **machine learning systems**, with realization and applications in outlier detection, healthcare, graph neural networks, and ensemble learning. 

üî≠ **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

* **machine learning systems** that can **speed/scale up** and **automate** underlying algorithms 
* **data mining algorithms** like **outlier detection** (anomaly detection) and ensemble learning

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) from [DATA Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/) on outlier detection,
[Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) from [Catalyst](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) on machine learning systems, 
and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) on general ML and statistics. 
Externally, I am also fortunate to visit and collaborate with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford University.

üòÑ **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type)
- **paper review**, tutorial, workshop, and talk opportunities

üí¨ **News & Travel**:


- **Jan 2022**: Accepted an invite @ [Andalusian Research Institute in Data Science and Computational Intelligence (DaSCI)](https://dasci.es/) to present my recent work on outlier detection.

- **Jan 2022**: Have a new preprint called [ECOD: Unsupervised Outlier Detection Using Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/22-preprint-ecod.pdf) under the 2nd round review at TKDE!
ECOD is a simple yet effect detection algorithm that is not only accurate but extremely fast with O(nd) complexity.

- **Dec 2021**: &#127775; Reached 600 citations on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zoGDYsoAAAAJ)!

- **Dec 2021**: Have new system out **TOD: Tensor-based Outlier Detection, A General GPU-Accelerated Framework**. with George H. Chen and Zhihao Jia.
[Preprint](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-preprint-tod.pdf), [Code being released](https://github.com/yzhao062/pytod)

  - **TOD** is the **first** fast, comprehensive, GPU-based outlier detection system. 
  - &#127775; on average it is **11 times faster than PyOD**!
  - &#127775; it supports various OD algorithms, e,g., kNN, LOF, ABOD, HBOS, etc.
