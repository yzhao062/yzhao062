### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
and an ex management consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).
As a seasoned ML software/system architect, I have led/participated [> 10 ML libraries initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), 10,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 800 out of 40M GitHub users), and >300,0000 total downloads.


🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **data mining** topics related to **outlier detection** (anomaly detection)
- **machine learning systems (MLSys)** that can **speed/scale up** and **automate** data mining and machine learning algorithms 

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu (Heinz)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) on outlier detection, 
[Prof. George H. Chen (Heinz)](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) on general ML,
and [Prof. Zhihao Jia (CSD)](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) on machine learning systems (MLSys).

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2022). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **May 2021**: I passed my 1st paper presentation (as part of my Ph.D. program requirements)–two more to go!

- **May 2021**: Have a new journal paper titled Copula-Based Outlier Detection under review. It is based on our ICDM’ 20 paper with more theoretical analysis. See [the extended journal version](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-preprint-copod-journal.pdf)!

- **Apr 2021**: How to evaluate/select outlier detection models without any external information (e.g., ground truth)? We have a [new preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01422.pdf) on using internal strategies for model selection. Do they suffice? [Check out our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01422.pdf)!
