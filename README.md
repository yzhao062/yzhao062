### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) 👋

😄 I am an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/); see more information at my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/).

**Prospective Students**. Openings and Timeline for PhD Offer. I am peacefully looking for Ph.D. students (from Fall 25) and interns (no earlier than Fall 2024). I prepared a procedure for the USC CS Ph.D. offer process and funding. See more at [my homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html).

🌱 **Research Interests**. I build reproducible, automated, and scalable **machine learning (ML)** and **data mining (DM)** benchmarks, algorithms, and systems, with a focus on but not limited to anomaly detection, graph neural networks, ML systems, and AI for healthcare, security, and finance.

1. **Benchmark** various learning algorithms for fair evaluation and new insights.
2. **Automate** ML by model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
3. **Design** large-scale ML systems for real-world applications.
4. **Develop** open-source ML tools to support applications in healthcare, finance, security, and more.


⚡  **Open-source Contribution**: I created PyOD (used by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and more) - the most popular library for anomaly detection in 2017. Also, I have led more than 10 ML open-source initiatives, receiving 20,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%) and >20M downloads. **Popular ones**: PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, ADBench
