### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üå± **Short Bio**: My name is Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese). I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/phd-programs/), 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Before joining CMU, I earned my Master degree from University of Toronto, and worked as a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html). 
I have coauthored more than 20 papers on anomaly detection, graph neural networks, automated ML, and machine learning systems in leading venues. 
Service-wide, I am on the conference program committee of KDD, AAAI, and IJCAI, and reviewing for JMLR, TPAMI, and TKDE.
I am one of the two recipients of the 2022 [Norton Labs Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/research-labs/news/2022-fellowship-winners/).
See my [homepage](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) and [CV](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/files/ZHAO_YUE_CV.pdf) for more information.

**Outlier detection systems (ODSys)**: I build automated, scalable, and accelerated **machine learning systems (MLSys)** to support large-scale 
real-world outlier detection applications in security, finance, and healthcare with millions of downloads. 
I designed CPU-based ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), 
GPU-based ([TOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/tod)), 
distributed detection systems ([SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod)) 
for tabular ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), time-series ([TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)), 
and graph data ([PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod)).
