### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
and an ex management consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).
As a seasoned ML software/system architect, I have led/participated [> 10 ML libraries initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), 9,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 800 out of 40M GitHub users), and >300,0000 total downloads.

**Regarding Leetcode style interview**: I strongly dislike the general programming interview, and would NOT do this type of "tests". 
You can trust my coding and design capacity :)

And of course, I am still a ML/DM researcher at the end of the day.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- data mining topics related to scalability, reliability, and automation and
- information systems questions related to interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and “AI”

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2021). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **Dec 2020**: Thrilled to join [Prof. Jure Leskovek](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/) @ Stanford University for a research internship/visit in 2021:) See u in CA (if not remotely)!

- **Dec 2020**: Have multiple invited talks on anomaly detection and general machine learning. Video to be released :)

- **Nov 2020**: [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/TDC/), a large collection of > 60 machine learning-ready datasets across more than 20 therapeutic tasks, is released. 
Great work led by [Prof. Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Kexin Huang](https://www.kexinhuang.com/) from Havard!

- **Nov 2020**: Our paper [A Data Denoising Approach to Optimize Functional Clustering of Single Cell RNA-sequencing Data]() is accepted at [IEEE BIBM 2020](https://ieeebibm.org/BIBM2020/). Great work [Changlin Wan](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wan82/)!

- **Oct 2020**: Our demo paper [TODS: An Automated Time Series Outlier Detection System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09822.pdf) is accepted at [AAAI 2021](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/aaai21demoscall/).
See the new Python library [TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods) [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bBXuDUe7s&feature=youtu.be) designed for time-series outlier detection. It is initialized and led by [DATA Lab @ Texas A&M University](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/people.html); 
I contribute to core detection model design and implementation.

- **Oct 2020**: Our paper [AutoAudit: Mining Accounting and Time-Evolving Graphs](https://github.com/mengchillee/AutoAudit) will appear in [BigData 2020](http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/). It is a system for
detecting anomalies in time-evolving graphs. Great work with Meng-Chieh Lee, Aluna Wang, Pierre Jinghong Liang, Leman Akoglu, Vincent S. Tseng, and Christos Faloutsos!


- **Oct 2020**: Have a new system paper ([SUOD: Accelerating Large-scare Unsupervised Heterogeneous Outlier Detection](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/20-preprint-suod.pdf)) under review at a major ML conference. [SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/SUOD) is an
acceleration system for large-scale unsupervised outlier detection. It has been downloaded by more than 700,000 times, included as part of [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod), and presented in *AAAI Workshop on* [*Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)*](http://aics.site/AICS2020/).


- **Sep 2020**: We have a new paper [Automating Outlier Detection via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10606) ([code](https://github.com/yzhao062/MetaOD)) out. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised meta-learner that can select (recommend) the most performing outlier detection model on an arbitrary dataset. 


- **Sep 2020**: Our paper [COPOD: Copula-Based Outlier Detection](papers/20-icdm-copod.pdf) (camera-ready version) will appear in [ICDM 2020](http://icdm2020.bigke.org/) soon!
It is a **fast, parameter-free, and highly interpretable unsupervised outlier detection algorithm** and available in [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) now.
