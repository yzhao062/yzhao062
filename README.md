### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üå± **Short Bio**: My name is Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese). I am a rising 4-th year Ph.D. student at 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Before joining CMU, I earned my Master degree from University of Toronto (2016) and Bachelor degree from University of Cincinnati (2015), and worked as a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html) (2016-19). 
I am an expert on anomaly detection (a.k.a outlier detection) algorithms, systems, and its applications in security, healthcare, and Finance, 
with more than 7-year professional experience and 20+ papers (in JMLR, TKDE, NeurIPS, etc.). 
I appreciate the support from [Norton Labs Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/research-labs/news/2022-fellowship-winners/).
See my [homepage](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) and [CV](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/files/ZHAO_YUE_CV.pdf) for more information.

**Contributions to outlier detection systems, benchmarks, and applications**: I build automated, scalable, and accelerated *machine learning systems (MLSys)* to support large-scale, 
real-world outlier detection applications in security, finance, and healthcare with millions of downloads. 
I designed CPU-based ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), 
GPU-based ([TOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/tod)), 
distributed detection systems ([SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod)) 
for tabular ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), time-series ([TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)), 
and graph data ([PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod)). 
To understand the characteristics of OD algorithms, I co-author *large-scale benchmarks* for tabular data ([ADBench](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/22-preprint-adbench.pdf)),
time-series data ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr)), and graph data ([UNOD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10071)).
My work has been widely used by thousands of *projects and applications*, including leading firms like IBM, Morgan Stanley, and Tesla. See [more applications](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/network/dependents).
