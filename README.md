### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) 👋

😄 I am an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/); see the latest information at my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/).

**Prospective Students**.We plan to recruit 1-2 Ph.D. students for Fall 2025. For undergraduate/graduate interns, it will be considered on a case basis. I personally do not want to have a large group of "interns" without enough support. See details at [my homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html).

🌱 **Research Interests**. My work focuses on creating _robust_, _efficient_, and _automated_ **machine learning (ML)** and **data mining (DM)** algorithms, systems, and applications. My primary areas of interest are:

1. **Robustness and Security of AI**: Enhancing the robustness and security of AI systems through out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, outlier detection, and anomaly detection.
2. **Efficient and Scalable AI**: Developing efficient and scalable ML systems and automation techniques.
3. **Applications in Security, Finance, and Healthcare**: Applying AI technologies to address complex problems in security, finance, and healthcare sectors.


⚡  **Open-source Contribution**: I created PyOD (used by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and more) - the most popular library for anomaly detection in 2017. Also, I have led more than 10 ML open-source initiatives, receiving 20,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%) and >22M downloads. **Popular ones**: PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, ADBench
