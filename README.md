### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) 👋

😄 I am an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/); see the latest information at my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/).

**Prospective Students**. We are seeking to recruit **2 Ph.D. students** for Fall 2026. Applicants are required to have at least one paper published in a top ML, System, or LLM conference.  We also have openings for **undergraduate and graduate interns**, both from USC and other institutions. For all positions, please complete this Google Form: [Application Form](https://forms.gle/F2ZXqFWh9wgmUcHDA). Additionally, Ph.D. candidates are required to email me directly after submitting the form.  See details at [my homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html).

🌱 **Research Interests**. My research is centered on the development of *robust*, *efficient*, and *automated* **machine learning (ML)** algorithms, systems, and applications. My key areas of focus include:

1. **Robust and Trustworthy AI:**  Enhancing AI systems with capabilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, outlier detection (OD), and anomaly detection to improve reliability and trust.

2. **Efficient and Automated AI:**  Developing ML systems that operate with minimal human supervision, optimizing for performance and automation.

3. **AI for Applications and Science:**  Applying AI technologies to solve complex problems in fields such as drug discovery, security, finance, healthcare, and political science.

4. **Foundation Models and Generative AI for OD/OOD:**  Investigating the interplay between OD/OOD and advanced models like large language models (LLMs), enhancing both fields.


⚡  **Open-source Contribution**: I created PyOD (used by NASA, Tesla, Morgan Stanley, and more) - the most popular library for anomaly detection in 2017. Also, I have led more than 10 ML open-source initiatives, receiving 20,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%) and >22M downloads. **Popular ones**: PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, ADBench
