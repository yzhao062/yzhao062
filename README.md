### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üòÑ **I am on the market with expected graduation in Summer 2023**. I am broadly interested in *machine learning*, *data mining/science*, and *information systems* positions.{{< /hl >}}
I am a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., Canada, and China. Please reach out by email (zhaoy [AT] cmu.edu)

üå± **Short Bio**: I will graduate from 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) in June 2022 (finishing up in 4 years).
I am an expert on unsupervised machine learning, anomaly detection (a.k.a outlier detection), machine learning systems (MLSys), and
automated machine learning (AutoML), with more than 7-year professional experience and 30+
papers (in JMLR, NeurIPS, VLDB, MLsys, etc.) 
I appreciate the support from CMU [Presidential Fellowship](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/scholarships-and-grants/university.html) and [Norton Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/research-labs/news/2022-fellowship-winners/).

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) for **automated data mining**, [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) for **machine learning systems**,
and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) for general ML.
I am a member of  [CMU automated learning systems group (Catalyst)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/).
Externally, I collaborate with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/) at UIC.
