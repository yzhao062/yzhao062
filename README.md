### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üòÑ I will be an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) in August 2023. Hats off to my mentors. More details on intern/visitor, graduate student, and postdoc recruitment to follow.

üå± **Short Bio**: In May 2023, I will finish my Ph.D. in 4 years at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
**My research accelerates and automates unsupervised ML**: (1) how to support large-scale learning tasks with **ML systems** and (2) how to **automate** unsupervised ML model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
I build AI/ML applications in **finance**, **healthcare**, and **security**.
I was a senior consultant/associate at PwC Canada from 2017-2019.

![Research Overview](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/img/overview.png)

**Mentors**. At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) for **automated ML**, [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) for **machine learning systems**, and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) for general ML.
I am a member of  [CMU automated learning systems group (Catalyst)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/).
I have collaborated with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/) at UIC.


See my [homepage](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) and [CV](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/files/ZHAO_YUE_CV.pdf) for more information.


üî≠ **Research outcomes**. I have published more than 30 papers in leading journals such as JMLR, NeurIPS, VLDB, and MLsys
