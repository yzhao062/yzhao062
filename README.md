### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã


I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/phd-programs/), 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/)--the best interdisciplinary research institute in the world. 
Before joining CMU, I was a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).

I have led/participated [> 10 ML open-source initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), receiving 11,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 900 out of 40M GitHub users) and >500,0000 total downloads.


I specialize in designing and building **machine learning systems**, with realization and applications in outlier detection, healthcare, graph neural networks, and ensemble learning. 

üî≠ **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **data mining** topics related to **outlier detection** (anomaly detection)
- **machine learning systems (MLSys)** that can **speed/scale up** and **automate** data mining and machine learning algorithms 

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) from [DATA Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/) on outlier detection, 
[Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) on general ML and statistics,
and [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) from [Catalyst](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) on machine learning systems. 
I am currently visiting [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/), Stanford University.

üòÑ **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type)
- paper review, tutorial, workshop, and talk opportunities
- **Summer Internship**: **Open to ML/Engineering Internship (Summer 2022). Please reach out :)**

üí¨ **News & Travel**:

- **Sep 2021**: Happy to spend my summer (as a member of the [PyG team](https://github.com/pyg-team)) for adding some cool features to [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://www.pyg.org/). Check out [PyG 2.0](https://www.pyg.org/PyG2.0-released)!


- **Aug 2021**: Two impactful large-scale ML initiatives are accepted to [NeurIPS 2021 (Datasets and Benchmarks track)](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks).
See the papers on OpenReview: (1) [Therapeutics Data Commons: Machine Learning Datasets and Tasks for Drug Discovery and Development](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8nvgnORnoWr) and
(2) [Revisiting Time Series Outlier Detection: Definitions and Benchmarks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr). 

- **May-Aug 2021**: Visiting at Standford University in [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/) by [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/).

- **May 2021**: Have a new journal paper titled Copula-Based Outlier Detection under review. It is based on our ICDM‚Äô 20 paper with more theoretical analysis. See [the extended journal version](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-preprint-copod-journal.pdf)!
