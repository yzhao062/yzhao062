### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã

üå± **Short Bio**: My name is Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese). I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/phd-programs/), 
[Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Before joining CMU, I earned my Master degree from University of Toronto, and worked as a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html). 
I have coauthored more than 20 papers on anomaly detection, automated ML, and machine learning systems in leading venues. 
Service-wide, I am on the conference program committee of KDD, AAAI, and IJCAI, and reviewing for JMLR, TPAMI, and TKDE.
I am a recipient of the 2022 [Norton Labs Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/careers/graduate-fellowship/) 
(one of the two graduate students worldwide).
See my [homepage](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) and [CV](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/files/ZHAO_YUE_CV.pdf) for more information.

I consider myself as an expert in **outlier detection systems** (ODSys)---I build automated, scalable ODSys to support
real-world applications in security and finance with millions of downloads. 
I designed CPU-based ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), 
GPU-based ([TOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/tod)), 
distributed detection systems ([SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod)) 
for tabular, time-series ([TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)), 
and graph data ([PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod)).

**Community**: I am organizing **the largest open-source community of outlier detection**, including
(1) the most popular detection system [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) (6M downloads, top 10 data mining projects on GitHub)
(2) the most watched and starred [Anomaly Detection Resources](https://github.com/yzhao062/anomaly-detection-resources) with hundreds of books, tutorial, and papers (5k+ stars)
(3) the discussion groups with hundreds of outlier detection researchers and practitioners from MIT, Meta, and more (see contact section below for joining).

üî≠ **Research-wise**, I specialize in designing and building *automated*, *scalable*, and *accelerated* **machine learning systems** (MLSys), 
with realization and applications in **outlier detection**, healthcare, graph neural networks, and ensemble learning.

- Outlier detection systems (JMLR'19, AAAI'21, MLsys'21, NeurIPS'21)
- Outlier detection algorithms (IJCNN'18, SDM'19, BigData'20, ICDM'20, TKDE'22)
- Automated outlier detection (NeuIPS'21)
- AI x Science (AAAI'20, NeuIPS'21)

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) from [DATA Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/) on outlier detection,
[Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) from [Catalyst](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) on machine learning systems, 
and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) on general ML and statistic methods. 
Externally, I am also fortunate to visit and collaborate with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford University.
