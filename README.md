### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/) 👋

😄 I am an Assistant Professor at [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/); see more information at my [homepage](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/).

🌱 **My research**: I build **fast** and **automated** machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) **systems**, with a focus on but not limited to graph neural networks and anomaly detection.

1. Accelerate large-scale learning tasks by leveraging ML systems techniques.
2. Automate unsupervised ML by model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
3. Develop open-source ML tools to support applications in healthcare, finance, and security.


**Ph.D. time**. At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) for **automated ML**, [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) for **machine learning systems**, and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) for general ML.
I am a member of  [CMU automated learning systems group (Catalyst)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/).
I have collaborated with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/) at UIC.


⚡  **Open-source Contribution**: I have **led** or **contributed as a core member** to [more than 10 ML open-source initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), 
receiving 15,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: [ranked 800 out of 40M GitHub users](https://gitstar-ranking.com/yzhao062)) and >20,000,000 total downloads.
