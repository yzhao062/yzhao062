### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am also a seasoned machine learning (ML) software/system architect with [10 ML libraries](https://github.com/yzhao062), 8,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 820 out of 40M GitHub users), and >200,0000 total downloads.

**Good news: I am looking for 2021 Summer ML/DM Internship in Canada, United States, or China. Not necessarily pure research; system or AutoML related stuff would be great fit as well.** Just reach out and we could work something out :)

And of course, I am still a ML/DM researcher at the end of the day.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- data mining topics related to scalability, reliability, and automation and
- information systems questions related to interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and “AI”

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2021). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **Oct 2020**: Have a new system paper ([SUOD: Accelerating Large-scare Unsupervised Heterogeneous Outlier Detection](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/20-preprint-suod.pdf)) under review at a major ML conference. [SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/SUOD) is an
acceleration system for large-scale unsupervised outlier detection. It has been downloaded by more than 700,000 times, included as part of [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod), and presented in *AAAI Workshop on* [*Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)*](http://aics.site/AICS2020/).


- **Sep 2020**: We have a new paper [Automating Outlier Detection via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10606) ([code](https://github.com/yzhao062/MetaOD)) out. In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised meta-learner that can select (recommend) the most performing outlier detection model on an arbitrary dataset. 

- **Sep 2020**: Our new library [TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods), a Python library for time-series outlier detection is out. It is initialized and led by [DATA Lab @ Texas A&M University](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/people.html), 
and I contribute to core detection model design and implementation. See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09822.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bBXuDUe7s&feature=youtu.be) under submission @ [AAAI 2021 (demo)](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/aaai21demoscall/).

- **Sep 2020**: Our paper [COPOD: Copula-Based Outlier Detection](papers/20-icdm-copod.pdf) (camera-ready version) will appear in [ICDM 2020](http://icdm2020.bigke.org/) soon!
It is a **fast, parameter-free, and highly interpretable unsupervised outlier detection algorithm** and available in [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) now.

- **Sep 2020**: Have a paper accepted at [ICDM Workshops 2020 (ICDMW)](https://msdm20.loria.fr/). A personal copy can be found here: [SynC: A Copula based Framework for Generating Synthetic Data from Aggregated Sources](papers/20-icdmw-sync.pdf).
