### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋

😄 I will join [USC Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) as an Assistant Professor at in August 2023 (more details on intern/visitor, graduate student, and postdoc recruitment to follow.)

🌱 **Short Bio**: I got my Ph.D. in 4 years at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).
**My research accelerates and automates unsupervised ML**: (1) how to support large-scale learning tasks with **ML systems** and (2) how to **automate** unsupervised ML model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
I build AI/ML applications in **finance**, **healthcare**, and **security**.
I was a senior consultant/associate at PwC Canada from 2017-2019.

**Ph.D. time**. At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) for **automated ML**, [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) for **machine learning systems**, and [Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) for general ML.
I am a member of  [CMU automated learning systems group (Catalyst)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/).
I have collaborated with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) at Stanford and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/) at UIC.
