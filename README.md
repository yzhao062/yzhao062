### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (ËµµË∂ä in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) üëã


I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
and an ex management consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html).
I have led/participated [> 10 ML open-source initiatives](https://github.com/yzhao062), receiving 10,000 GitHub stars (top 0.002%: ranked 900 out of 40M GitHub users) and >400,0000 total downloads.


I specialize in designing and building **machine learning systems**, with realization and applications in outlier detection, healthcare, graph neural networks, and ensemble learning. 

üî≠ **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- **data mining** topics related to **outlier detection** (anomaly detection)
- **machine learning systems (MLSys)** that can **speed/scale up** and **automate** data mining and machine learning algorithms 

At CMU, I work with [Prof. Leman Akoglu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lakoglu/) on outlier detection, 
[Prof. George H. Chen](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) on general ML,
and [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2) on machine learning systems (MLSys).
I am currently visiting at Standford University in [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/) by [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/).

üòÑ **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2022). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

üí¨ **News & Travel**:

- **Jun 2021**: Two impactful large-scale ML initiatives are under submission at [NeurIPS 2021 (Datasets and Benchmarks)](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks).
Please check out and follow them on OpenReview: (1) [Therapeutics Data Commons: Machine Learning Datasets and Tasks for Drug Discovery and Development](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8nvgnORnoWr) and
(2) [Revisiting Time Series Outlier Detection: Definitions and Benchmarks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr).

- **May-Aug 2021**: Visiting at Standford University in [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/) by [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/).

- **May 2021**: Have a new journal paper titled Copula-Based Outlier Detection under review. It is based on our ICDM‚Äô 20 paper with more theoretical analysis. See [the extended journal version](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/21-preprint-copod-journal.pdf)!

- **Apr 2021**: How to evaluate/select outlier detection models without any external information (e.g., ground truth)? We have a [new preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01422.pdf) on using internal strategies for model selection. Do they suffice? [Check out our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01422.pdf)!
